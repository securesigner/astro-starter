## Product Title

**Small Business Astro Starter — Production-Ready Website Template**

## Tagline

A complete, modern website template for small businesses. Built with Astro 5, Tailwind CSS v4, and React — optimized for speed, SEO, and accessibility out of the box.

---

## Description

### Build your business website the right way — without starting from scratch.

This isn't another bare-bones starter. It's a **complete, production-ready website** built with the same technologies and best practices used by top agencies — packaged so you can customize it and launch fast.

Every page is designed, every component is accessible, every meta tag is in place. You get a blog, service pages, a contact form, dark mode, dynamic OG images, and perfect Lighthouse scores — all wired up and ready to go.

### Who is this for?

- **Small business owners** who want a fast, professional website without hiring a developer
- **Freelancers and agencies** who need a solid starting point for client projects
- **Developers** who want a well-architected Astro 5 reference with tests and best practices baked in

### What makes this different?

Most templates look good in a demo but fall apart when you try to customize them. This one is built to be **yours** — every spot that needs personalization is marked with a searchable `CUSTOMIZE` comment, and there's a step-by-step SETUP guide for non-developers. The codebase is clean, documented, and backed by 135+ unit tests and 80+ E2E tests.

**What tech skills do I need?**
Basic familiarity with editing text files and using a terminal. The included SETUP.md guide walks you through everything step by step, including installing Node.js and deploying.

**Can I use this for client projects?**
Yes — the MIT license allows commercial use, modification, and redistribution. You can use it for as many projects as you want.

**What can I customize?**
Everything. Colors, fonts, content, pages, components — it's all yours. Every customization point is marked with a searchable `CUSTOMIZE` comment in the code.
